// TestViewTimeoutAndRecovery is a detailed, "white-box" test that verifies the
// precise mechanics of the view change protocol. It simulates a leader failure
// mid-round (after a proposal is sent) and meticulously checks the following:
//   - The exact timing of timeout events.
//   - The correct sequence of all view change-related events (Timeout, LeaderElected, NewView).
//   - The successful completion of a full consensus round in the new view.
//   - The adherence to safety rules (e.g., preventing duplicate proposals).
//   - Quorum requirements for all QCs in the new view.
//
// This test ensures the fundamental correctness of the view change implementation.
// It implements test 1.1 from task 05-04-view-change-flow-integration.md
