# MuSig2 vs. FROST: A Comparative Analysis for Taproot Multisignatures

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of the MuSig2 and FROST signature schemes, with a focus on their application to Bitcoin Taproot multisignatures. The goal is to evaluate their performance, security, implementation complexity, and scalability to inform the selection of a multisignature scheme for a federation of participants.

**MuSig2** is a simple and efficient two-round multisignature scheme that produces standard Schnorr signatures. It is designed for `n-of-n` scenarios, where all `n` participants must cooperate to create a signature. Its main advantages are its simplicity and low communication overhead.

**FROST** (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) is a more complex scheme designed for `t-of-n` threshold signatures. It allows a subgroup of `t` participants out of a total of `n` to produce a valid signature. This provides greater flexibility and redundancy at the cost of increased protocol complexity.

This analysis will delve into the trade-offs between these two schemes, particularly for federation sizes ranging from 64 to 512+ participants.

## 2. Comparative Analysis

### 2.1. High-Level Overview

The fundamental difference between MuSig2 and FROST lies in their participation model:

*   **MuSig2 (`n-of-n`)**: Requires all defined signers to participate in each signing operation. This is simpler but less flexible, as any unavailable signer can block the signing process.
*   **FROST (`t-of-n`)**: Requires only a threshold `t` of `n` total signers. This provides high availability and redundancy, as the system can tolerate up to `n-t` offline or failed signers.

| Feature                  | MuSig2                                     | FROST                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Type**                 | Multisignature                             | Threshold Signature                                                |
| **Participation**        | `n-of-n` (all required)                    | `t-of-n` (threshold required)                                      |
| **Rounds (Signing)**     | 2                                          | 2 (or 1 with preprocessing)                                        |
| **Key Generation**       | Simple, non-interactive aggregation      | Complex, requires a trusted dealer or Distributed Key Generation (DKG) |
| **Primary Advantage**    | Simplicity, efficiency for `n-of-n`        | Flexibility, redundancy, robustness against unavailable signers    |
| **Primary Disadvantage** | No native threshold signing support        | Higher complexity in key generation and signing coordination       |

### 2.2. Performance

Performance is analyzed based on academic papers and public benchmarks from projects like Zcash Foundation.

#### Key Generation

*   **MuSig2**: Key generation is extremely efficient. Each participant generates a key pair independently. The group's public key is the sum of all individual public keys. This process is non-interactive.
*   **FROST**: Key generation is a significant performance and complexity bottleneck. It requires a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol to create secret shares for each participant without a trusted dealer. The DKG protocol involves multiple communication rounds between all participants. For a trusted dealer setup, the dealer generates the key and distributes shares. The Zcash Foundation benchmarks (using a trusted dealer) show that for a `667-of-1000` setup, key generation takes approximately **123-181ms** depending on the curve. A full DKG would be significantly slower.

#### Signing

*   **MuSig2**: Signing involves two communication rounds. The performance is generally very fast. Benchmarks from `musig-benchmark` show millions of signatures can be generated per second on a modern machine, indicating the raw crypto operations are not a bottleneck. The main bottleneck will be network latency between participants.
*   **FROST**: Signing can be done in two rounds, or one round with a pre-processing step to generate nonces. The Zcash Foundation benchmarks for a `67-of-100` setup on `secp256k1` show:
    *   **Round 1 (per signer)**: ~0.09ms (negligible)
    *   **Round 2 (per signer)**: ~4.41ms
    *   **Aggregate (coordinator)**: ~3.82ms

For a larger `667-of-1000` setup, the numbers are:
    *   **Round 1 (per signer)**: ~0.09ms
    *   **Round 2 (per signer)**: ~46.11ms
    *   **Aggregate (coordinator)**: ~37.48ms

Recent optimizations using multi-scalar multiplication have significantly improved the performance of the aggregation step, making it more scalable.

#### Verification

Both MuSig2 and FROST produce standard Schnorr signatures. Therefore, the verification time is identical for both and is equivalent to a single-party Schnorr signature verification. This is a significant advantage for both schemes as it does not add any overhead to the verifier.

### 2.3. Security

*   **MuSig2**: The security of MuSig2 is proven in the random oracle model and relies on the hardness of the Discrete Logarithm Problem. The scheme is secure against concurrent session attacks. A key security consideration is the protection against rogue-key attacks, which MuSig2 addresses.
*   **FROST**: FROST is also proven secure, and its security proof is more complex due to the threshold nature of the scheme. It is designed to be secure against an adversary controlling up to `t-1` participants. FROST includes binding to the message and participant set to prevent cross-signature attacks. It trades off robustness for performance: the protocol aborts if a participant misbehaves, but the misbehaving party is identifiable.

### 2.4. Implementation Complexity

*   **MuSig2**: MuSig2 is significantly simpler to implement than FROST. The protocol logic is straightforward, and there is no need for a complex DKG. This reduces development time and the potential for implementation errors.
*   **FROST**: FROST is substantially more complex.
    *   **DKG**: Implementing a secure and robust DKG is a major challenge. It's a complex multi-round protocol that requires careful implementation to prevent vulnerabilities.
    *   **Signing Coordination**: The signing process requires a coordinator to aggregate commitments and signature shares. The logic to handle `t` out of `n` participants is more complex than MuSig2's `n-of-n` model.
    *   **State Management**: Participants need to manage their secret shares and nonces securely.
    
Despite its complexity, there are existing open-source implementations of FROST (e.g., from the Zcash Foundation in Rust) that can be used as a reference.

### 2.5. Scalability

*   **MuSig2**: MuSig2 scales well in terms of raw cryptographic operations. However, the `n-of-n` requirement is a major scalability bottleneck in practice. As the number of participants grows, the probability of one participant being unavailable increases, which can halt the signing process entirely. The communication overhead also grows with the number of participants.
*   **FROST**: FROST is designed for scalability in terms of participants. The `t-of-n` model provides high availability. Performance-wise, the signing and aggregation costs scale linearly with the number of signing participants (`t`). However, as shown in the Zcash benchmarks and optimizations, with techniques like multi-scalar multiplication, the performance remains practical even for very large federations (e.g., 667-of-1000). The DKG phase is the main scalability concern for setting up or changing the federation.

## 4. Recommendations

The choice between MuSig2 and FROST depends heavily on the specific requirements of the federation.

*   **Choose MuSig2 if:**
    *   The number of participants is small (e.g., < 10).
    *   High availability of all participants can be guaranteed.
    *   Simplicity of implementation and lower development cost are critical priorities.
    *   An `n-of-n` security model is sufficient and desired.

*   **Choose FROST if:**
    *   The number of participants is large (e.g., 64 to 512+).
    *   High availability and resilience against offline/failed participants are required.
    *   A `t-of-n` threshold security model is necessary.
    *   The complexity of implementing or integrating a DKG and the more involved signing protocol is acceptable.

For a large-scale federation as specified in the requirements (64-512+ participants), **FROST is the superior choice**. The `n-of-n` model of MuSig2 is not practical at this scale, as it would be too fragile. The flexibility and resilience of FROST's `t-of-n` model are essential for maintaining a robust and available system with a large number of signers. While the implementation is more complex, the benefits in terms of scalability and reliability for a large federation far outweigh the development overhead.
