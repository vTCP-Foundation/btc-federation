# MuSig2 vs FROST Comparative Analysis for Large-Scale Bitcoin Federations

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares MuSig2 and FROST signature schemes for Bitcoin federations with 64-512+ participants, evaluating their suitability for large-scale multi-signature operations. Key findings indicate that while MuSig2 excels in simplicity and Taproot integration, FROST provides superior flexibility through threshold configurations, making the choice dependent on specific federation requirements.

## 1. Introduction

Bitcoin federations require robust multi-signature schemes that can handle large numbers of participants while maintaining security, efficiency, and practical implementability. Two prominent schemes have emerged as candidates for large-scale deployments:

- **MuSig2**: A two-round, n-of-n multi-signature scheme producing standard Schnorr signatures
- **FROST**: A threshold signature scheme supporting flexible t-of-n configurations

This analysis evaluates both schemes across critical dimensions for federations scaling from 64 to 512+ participants.

## 2. Technical Overview

### 2.1 MuSig2 Architecture

MuSig2, standardized in BIP 327, is a two-round multi-signature scheme that:
- Produces ordinary Schnorr signatures indistinguishable from single-key signatures
- Requires all n participants for signature generation (n-of-n)
- Utilizes two communication rounds: nonce commitment and signature generation
- Provides security under the Algebraic One-More Discrete Logarithm (AOMDL) assumption

**Key Properties:**
- Transaction size: 57.5vB (vs 104.5vB for native SegWit multisig)
- Perfect forward secrecy through session-specific nonces
- Direct Taproot compatibility for key-path spending

### 2.2 FROST Architecture

FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signatures) provides:
- Threshold signature capability (t-of-n where t ≤ n)
- Two-round signing protocol similar to MuSig2
- Shamir's secret sharing for key distribution
- Robust security against up to t-1 malicious participants

**Key Properties:**
- Configurable threshold levels
- Dealer-based or distributed key generation
- Compatible with existing Schnorr signature verification

## 3. Comparative Analysis by Federation Size

### 3.1 Small Federations (64-128 participants)

#### Performance Metrics

| Metric | MuSig2 | FROST |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Communication Rounds | 2 | 2 |
| Signature Size | 64 bytes | 64 bytes |
| Network Messages | 2n | 2t (where t ≤ n) |
| Computation per Node | O(n) | O(t) + preprocessing |

**MuSig2 Advantages:**
- Lower computational overhead per participant
- Simpler nonce aggregation process
- Direct BIP 327 standardization support

**FROST Advantages:**
- Operational flexibility with threshold configurations
- Fault tolerance (can operate with t participants online)
- Better suited for scenarios with intermittent connectivity

#### Security Considerations

**MuSig2:**
- Requires all participants to be online and honest
- Single point of failure if any participant is compromised during signing
- Strong security guarantees under AOMDL assumption

**FROST:**
- Tolerates up to t-1 malicious participants
- Requires secure dealer for key generation (or DKG protocol)
- More complex security model with additional attack vectors

### 3.2 Medium Federations (128-256 participants)

#### Scalability Challenges

At this scale, both schemes face increasing complexity:

**MuSig2 Scaling Issues:**
- O(n²) verification complexity for nonce aggregation
- All-or-nothing participation requirement becomes problematic
- Network coordination complexity increases significantly

**FROST Scaling Advantages:**
- Threshold flexibility allows for operational efficiency
- Only t participants need to be active for signing
- Better resilience to network partitions

#### Implementation Complexity

**MuSig2:**
- Simpler state management
- Deterministic nonce generation recommended for large groups
- Fewer cryptographic primitives required

**FROST:**
- Complex key share distribution
- Threshold parameter optimization required
- Additional security considerations for share storage

### 3.3 Large Federations (256-512+ participants)

#### Performance Analysis

For very large federations, performance characteristics diverge significantly:

**Network Communication:**
- MuSig2: Requires coordination among all 512 participants
- FROST: Only threshold subset (e.g., 341 of 512) needs coordination

**Computational Load:**
- MuSig2: Linear growth in verification time
- FROST: Bounded by threshold size, not total federation size

**Storage Requirements:**
- MuSig2: O(n) storage per participant for session state
- FROST: O(1) key share storage, O(t) for active signing sessions

#### Reliability and Availability

**MuSig2 Challenges at Scale:**
- Single participant failure prevents signature generation
- Coordination becomes exponentially difficult
- Susceptible to DoS attacks targeting any participant

**FROST Advantages:**
- Built-in fault tolerance
- Graceful degradation with participant failures
- Configurable availability vs security trade-offs
